## Things to remember when making an American ‘L’ sound…
* <font color="blue">Your bottom jaw should be as wide open as possible.  
* <font color="blue">Your tongue should RISE UP (independently of your jaw) and touch right 
behind your top teeth.  
* <font color="blue">Produce the ‘L’ sound by dropping and relaxing your tongue.  
* <font color="blue">Practice “LA, LA, LA”, keeping your bottom jaw lowered and open while 
only raising your tongue.

### ‘L’ at the end of a word

<font color="blue">To produce an ‘L’ at the end of a word, remember to slowly raise your tongue upward, towards your upper teeth, while keeping your bottom jaw as open as possible.  The ‘L’ sound comes from the tongue movement, not from the placement.

<font color="blue">(Using your finger to push down on your  bottom teeth to keep your jaw open, may be helpful for practicing.)
