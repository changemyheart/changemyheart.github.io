     S        »       Z     
 ---------- ------ -------- 

### Three rules for S/Z endings
>This is easier than it looks!

#### Rule #1
If a word ends in a sound that is unvoiced (such as P,T,K,F), you add an unvoiced /S/

*Examples*:  

---------- ----------- 
  1 cup      2 cups    
  1 cat      2 cats    
 I  break   He breaks  
 I  stop    He stops   
---------- ----------- 


#### Rule #2
If a word ends in any of these sounds: ‘s z sh ch dg (j)’  
when adding an ‘S’ ending, add…  IZZZZZZ

*Examples*: 

 ---------- ------------ 
  1  Page    2 Pages      
  1  Bus     2 Buses    
  1  Lunch   2 Lunches   
  I  Raise   He Raises   
  I  Brush   He Brushes  
  I  Push    He Pushes   
 ---------- ------------ 

#### Rule #3   
If a word ends in a vowel sound (like the word Tree) or a voiced consonant (like the word Game), then when you add an ‘S’, continue the voicing throughout the entire word, and it should become a voiced ZZZZ.

*Examples*: 

----------  -------------------------------------- 
 1  Tree     2  Treezzzz (correctly spelled Trees)   
  1 Day                    2 Days                  
  1 Shoe                  2 Shoes                  
  I Fly                   He Flies                 
 1  Game                  2 Games                  
 1  Head                  2 Heads                  
 1  Train                 2 Trains                 
 1  Song                  2 Songs                  
----------  -------------------------------------- 

### Some common words where S’s are pronounced as Z’s  
<font color="blue"> **IS &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; HIS &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; AS &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; WAS &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; THESE &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; THOSE &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; EASY &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; BECAUSE**

### Paragraph Practice
If you have a color printer, notice that all voiced S/Z sounds are in the color Red to help you remember to add voicing. 

Another zippy, zappy, crazy day comes to a close.  As we zoom up to Joe's snooze zone, Zoe Jones of Zodiac Zoo plays with her zipper. 

Last week, Jim's brothers were picked to represent their country in the Olympic Games. Two of the brothers were swimmers, while the other two were long distance runners.  All of the brothers wore glasses. These athletes worked hard at qualifying for the games and were hoping to come home with prizes. Since the brothers go to the same university, they often take the same courses. This makes studying easier and gives them more time to do other things. 

On Thursday, I had a very lazy day. I woke up early and first squeezed oranges into juice. I then got dressed and watched the sunrise come up over the mountains. It was so beautiful that I took many pictures with my camera and I used three rolls of film. After drinking two cups of coffee, I got dressed, left the house, and walked three miles home.
