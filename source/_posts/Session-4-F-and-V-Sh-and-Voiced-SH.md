## Consonants ‘F’ and ‘V’
Consonants ‘F’ and ‘V’ are produced with contact of your upper teeth and 
lower lip.  Think of it as “biting your lower lip”.  Maintain a steady air stream. They are both identical, except the ‘F’ is unvoiced, and the ‘V’ is voiced. Correct voicing will make your speech clearer and more intelligible.
